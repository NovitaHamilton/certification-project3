Interactive task manager application with React-Redux, Node-Express, NoSQL DB, Testing &amp; Security

### Instructions
1. Develop an interactive task manager application with the following requirements:
 - [ ]  The application should support multiple task lists, thereby being able to create, update, and delete a task list.
 - [ ]  The user should have the option to add, delete, and update tasks in a task list. Some criteria that must exist in a task include priority (high, medium, low), completion status (todo, in progress, completed), and due date (date).
 - [ ]  The user should be able to display (on web page) the task lists, and also each respective task within the task lists.
 - [ ]  The user should be able to save a task list to a json file, or load a task list from a json file.
 - [ ]  The user should be able to specify which json file they are writing to, or reading from.

2. You will be required to add persistence in the form of reading from and writing to json files:
 - [ ]  Saving to, or loading from, a user-specified json file in the data directory.
 - [ ]  The following documentation should be helpful. The readFile and writeFile methods, in particular are required. Do not use the sync methods. 

3. Given the interactive nature of this implementation:
 - [ ] Feel free to make use of React components to accomplish this task.
 - [ ]  Itâ€™s advisable to first complete the application without any Redux, and then once everything is working, think about how you can use Redux to minimize the useState usage.
 - [ ] We will provide a slide covering how to approach adding Redux.
